# Follow the steps in the script
If you haven't go through the sql-data-warehouse-project-2025, then you can go [here]().
If you don't want to, that's completely okay. Just follow the steps seperated in the scripts directory. You can run scripts as ordered in this directory and you will eventually have the same analytics as I have done.
